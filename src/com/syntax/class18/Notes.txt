Constructors in Java:

What is a Constructor in Java?
    A Constructor is a special block of code that helps us give initial values to the fields of a class.
    Initialization of object or instance.
Why we should use a Constructor
    ex: Scanner input=new Scanner(System.in);
    ex2: Class main=new Class();
    1) When we use the constructor to initialize the object it looks more readable and cleaner.
    2) If the fields of a class are private it's nor possible to access them outside a class without
    a constructor or a method which means we can't initialize them without a method or a constructor.
    3) We can enforce rules like what kind of values are assigned to variables with the help of a
    constructor.
    4) If we want to make sure that some lines of code should always be executed when the object of a
    class is created. We can put the code inside the constructor.
How to use Constructors
    We create constructors inside the class and when an object of that class is created, the constructor
    is executed automatically.

class Car{
    String make;
    String model;

    Car(String carMake,String carModel,){
        make=carMake;
        model=carModel;
    }
    public static void main(String[] args){
    Car bmw=new Car("BMW",""S2"); //classes are custom data types

    }
}

Rules:
    1) Constructors don't have return types not even void.
    2) The name of the constructor should always be same as name of the class.
    3) Constructors can't be created with a static keyword.
    4) We can use any access modifiers with Constructor.
    5) If we don't create a constructor in a class a default constructor with zero parameters is created by
    compiler(Takes the code written by us. it converts that code to byte code which is easier for Java
    to understand).
    7) It is not allowed to have two constructors in a class with same number of parameters and same type

this keyword:
    We can use the "this" keyword to access the instance variables when you have the same name variables in
    your method or constructor or any block of code

this(): Not that common
    Calls the constructors of a class inside other constructors.
    Why we should use it: helps us reuse already written constructors if they contain same code.
    Why we want to create multiple constructors in the first place: we want to give user flexibility that
    we can create the objects of our class in many ways.
