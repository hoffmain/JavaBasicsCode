What is a List:
    List is an interface inside the collections' framework which have below properties
    1) Insertion order is maintained. Have complete control over index.
    2) I can Store duplicate data.

List is implemented by many classes by we will be focusing on ArrayList and LinkedList:
ArrayList:
    when my requirement is that if I will be reading the data a lot then I should be going with
    ArrayList.
LinkedList:
    Most of our operations will be writing the data to a list in between or in the start or shifting
    the data from one location to another location, we should be going with LinkedList.

Iterator:
    is an interface that has three methods hasNext() next() and remove().
    Whenever we try to modify the size of a list using a simple loop, there are chances that it
    will not work or will throw an error because lists are dynamic and can change the size at runtime.
    So to always be on the safe side, we should use Iterators.

=========================================
Set:
    Duplicates are not allowed

We will be discussing three types of Sets:
    1) HashSet 2) LinkedHashSet 3) TreeSet

HashSet:
    No Insertion order is maintained, but it is the fastest of all
LinkedHashSet:
    Upside: Insertion order is maintained
    Downside: Retrieval of elements will be extremely slow
    Insertions speed slower than HashSet
TreeSet:
    Upside: Elements will always be in sorted form
    Downside: Insertion speed is the slowest of all
    Retrieval speed better than LinkedList but slower than HashSet

=========================================
Map:
    is an interface in java that allow us to store key value pairs.
    We cannot have duplicate keys, but we can have duplicate values
    We will be discussing three of them:
        1) HashMap
        2) LinkedHashMap
        3) TreeMap

HashMap:
    Upside: Fastest when it comes to insert and retrieve the elements
    Downside: No insertion order

LinkedHashMap:
    Upside: Insertion order will be maintained.
    Downside: Retrieval will be slowest

TreeMap:
    Upside: Data will be stored in the sorted form based on the keys
    Downside: Insertion is the slowest
