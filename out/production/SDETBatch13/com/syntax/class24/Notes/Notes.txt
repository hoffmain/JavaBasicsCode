What is PolyMorphism:
    PolyMorphism is the ability of a method to behave differently depending upon the object or parameters
    that we pass to a method.
    When we pass different parameters to a method, and it behaves differently, then it is called static
    PolyMorphism or compile time PolyMorphism or early binding.
    When we achieve the PolyMorphism through method overriding then it is called dynamic binding or run
    time PolyMorphism or late binding.
Why we should use PolyMorphism:
    1) cleaner code.
    2) we never prefer to change the existing code if we want to improve something we always want to
    create new methods and new classes. We can call these methods using the parent classes variable/
    reference.
    3) we can call multiple methods from many classes with the help of a single variable. Like we can create
    the array of objects and with the help of a loop will be able to call all teh methods from all classes.
How can we use PolyMorphism:
    1) Create a parent child relationship.
    2) Override the methods in the child classes.
    3) Creating array of all the child class objects and with the help of loop you can call all the methods
    from all the child classes.
Rules:
    1) All the rules that apply for overriding also apply for the PolyMorphism.
    2) We can store the object of a child class inside a reference variable of type parent class, but we
    can't do the reverse.
    3) We can also create arrays of type parent and they can hold the objects of child classes
