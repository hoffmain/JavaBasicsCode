Exception in java:
    Exception is an unwanted behavior from the application that disrupts the normal flow of
    application.

Exception Handling:
    Exception handling is converting the complex system error messages to user-friendly error
    messages which are understandable by common people. We provide backup code that can be
    used if our primary logic fails.

Why we should Handle exceptions:
    1) To make the software user-friendly -developers
    2) It helps us make more robust(better) applications -developers
    3) We can figure out the exact line numbers and issues that are causing problems in our
    code (Most important point for all types of programmers)

What is the syntax, how do I use Exception handling in my code?
    We have new keywords: try, catch, finally, throw, and throws
try{
    we put the part of the code here that can cause exceptions (problematic code)
}catch(Create a variable of the class whose exception can be thrown){
    Backup code here
}

for example, we are trying to read a file, this is how we will write our code with exception
handling
String path="";
try{
    FileInputStream fis=new FileInputStream(path);
    Properties pro=new Properties();
    pro.load(fis);
}catch(IOException ioe){
    sout("please check the file at this path")
}
