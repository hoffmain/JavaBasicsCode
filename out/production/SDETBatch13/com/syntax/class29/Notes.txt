Set:
    Set in java does not allow duplicate values. There are many types of sets, but we will only
    discuss the most widely used one which are:
    1)HashSet  2)LinkedHashSet  3)TreeSet

HashSet:
    Upside: Most commonly used type of set, it is the fasted when it comes to insert and
    retrieve the data.
    Downside: Insertion order is not maintained.
    No get method to get a single value.
LinkedHashSet:
    Upside: Insertion order is maintained.
    Downside: Insertion speed is comparable to Hashset, but the retrieval speed is the slowest.
TreeSet:
    Upside: The data is stored in the sorted form.
    Downside: Insertion speed is slow. Retrieval speed is better than LinkedHashSet, but slower than
    HashSet.
Note:
Mostly used to remove duplicates
=======================================================
Maps:
    Allow to store key value pairs. First Entry is treated as key and the second one is treated as
    value. Keys can't be duplicate but values can be. Keys is the location of where the value is stored
    Map<Integer, String> items=new HashMap<>();
    There are many types of Maps as sets, but we will only discuss 3 of them:
    1)HashMap  2)LinkedHashMap  3)TreeMap

HashMap:
    Upside: it is the fasted when it comes to insert and retrieve the data.
    Downside: Insertion order is not maintained.
LinkedHashMap:
    Upside: Insertion order is maintained.
    Downside: Insertion speed slower than HashMap. Retrieval speed is slowest of all.
TreeMap:
    Upside: data is stored in the sorted form always.
    Downside: Insertion speed is very slow

Choose proper DataStructure.
    Q: I want to store unique names in the sorted form.
    A: TreeSet

    Q: I want to store the names of the students and most of the time I will be performing retrieval
    based on index.
    A: ArrayList

    Q: I want to store the items and their prizes, and maintain insertion order.
    A: LinkedHashMap
