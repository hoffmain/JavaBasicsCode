Exceptions in Java:
    Exceptions are unwanted behaviors that occur during the runtime(when java application is
    running) in Exception handling we write some kind of backup code to handle these runtime
    issues.
Why we should learn about exception handling:
    If we don't handle exceptions it can lead to bad user experience, which in turn leads to
    low profits and bad reputation for the company.
How we handle exceptions:
    We handle exceptions using below code block and keywords.
    try catch block finally block try catch finally throw and throws

Let's consider the below scenario:
    1) Read the data from an Excel file.
    2) Execute a loop to go through all the rows in an Excel file from Sheet1
    3) Open Syntax HRM Login page in Google Chrome browser
    4) Insert the data in the username and password field

What are the things that can go wrong?
    Assumption: I have tested this code very well on my computer, and it works perfectly fine.
    No one has changed the code.

Issues:
    1) Java program tries to read the file, but gets a file not found exception.
        Possible Causes:
            1) Someone has deleted or moved or renamed the file to a different location.
            2) File got corrupted because of a virus windows is not responding, or there are
            not enough resources on my computer to read a file.
    2) Someone changed the sheet name in somebody else's Excel file.
    3) Internet is down or website is not responding or Google Chrome is not installed or driver
    for Google Chrome is not present anymore in the specified location
    4) Password of the application is changed, and it is not updated in the Excel file etc.
