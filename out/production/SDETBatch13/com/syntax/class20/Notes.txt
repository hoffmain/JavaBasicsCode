What is Inheritance:
    a mechanism in java through which on class acquires the properties and methods of another class. It is
    one of the main pillars of OOPS
Why we should use Inheritance:
    1) it helps us reduce the amount of code that we have to write.
    2) it is more efficient.
    3) saves memory.
How can we use Inheritance:
    we can use the extends keyword after the class name and then the name of the class from which we want to
    inherit the code. For example:
class Parent{
String name="Newton";
String eyeColor=brown;
}
class Child extends Parent{

public void printInfo(){
System.out.print(name+" "+eyeColor);
}
}

Types of Inheritance:
    Different languages support different types of inheritances but 5 are very common.
    1) Single Inheritance- exists single base blass and single derived class
    2) Multilevel Inheritance
    3) Hierarchical Inheritance- a class has more than one sub class that all have the same parent class
    4) Multiple Inheritance- exists multiple parent classes and a single derived class
    5) Hybrid Inheritance
