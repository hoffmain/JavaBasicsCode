Access Modifiers:
    Access modifiers are keywords in java that help us control the access of classes, variables,
    methods, and other code of block. There are four access levels in java.
    Private, default(not a keyword), protected, public. We have three keywords that define these
    access levels: private, protected, public
Private:
    When we use the private keyword with a method of field it is only accessible inside that
    class. It is the most restricted access modifier.
Default(not a keyword):
    When we don't use any access modifier keyword with a field or a method then default access
    is applied by java which means we can access this variable or method inside the same as
    well as in all the other classes which exists inside the same package.
Protected:
    When we have protected access modifier we can access that method or variable inside the same
    class, plus inside the other classes which are inside the same package, plus inside the
    classes which are in different packages as well, but they must have extends relationship with
    the original class
Public:
    When we use the public access modifiers we can use that field or method anywhere inside the
    same project. We can access them in the class, plus in the package, plus in other packages
    in the project
