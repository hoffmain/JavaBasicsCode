FileHandling:
    Reading/writing data to a file is called file handling.
Why FileHandling is important:
    The data that changes frequently we don't put that data with code because if we have to change
    that data we need to recompile the code and redeploy the code on production servers again.
    It's a very lengthy process and might take weeks. The other issue is we might accidentally change
    the code as well when change the data and might introduce bugs.
How to handle files in java:
    we follow below steps to read and write data to files.
    1) we need to know the path of file
    2) navigate to that location using FileInputStream if we are planning to read the data from a file
    and FileOutputStream if we are planning to write the data from a file.
    3) need to use the proper class that can handle that file for example if we need to read/write
    data from properties class we can use the Properties class and XSSFWorkBook class for Excel files
