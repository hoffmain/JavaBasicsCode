There are three types of variables in Java: local, instance, static.
Local Variables:
    Are the variables which are created inside a block of code like method, loop, switch, if else condition, or a
    constructor.
Advantages:
    We should always prefer local variables to instance or static variables because they live for the
    shortest period of time inside your RAM.
Disadvantages:
    They can't be accessed outside the block of code in which they are created
Class Countries{

void USA() {

String person="Elisa Bro";
}
void Russia(){
System.out.println(person); // we will get an error because right now Person is only accessible in USA method
}

}

Instance Variables:
    They are created inside the class but outside a block of code.
Advantages:
    Instance variables are accessible everywhere in a class in all the blocks of code inside that class, but not
    in a static method.
Disadvantages:
    They keep on occupying the memory for longer period of time.

Static Variables:
    If we have as instance variable with a static keyword then it is called a static variable.
Advantages:
    They have the highest scope available even outside an object and are class level variables that's why
    it does not matter how many objects we create from that class only on variable is created;
    If we know that a value will stay same for all the objects of a class we should always go with static variable
    that way we can save a lot of memory
Disadvantages:
    They occupy the memory for the longest period of time
    They can hold only a single value for all the objects
